## What _vpype_ is?

_vpype_ is the Swiss-Army-knife command-line tool for plotter vector graphics. Here is what it can do:
 - **laying out** existing vector files with precise control on position, scale and page format;
 - **optimizing** existing SVG files for faster and cleaner plots;
 - creating **HPGL output** for vintage plotter;
 - creating **generative artwork** through built-in commands or plug-ins;
 - creating, modifying and processing **multi-layer vector files** for multi-colour plots;
 - and much more...
 
_vpype_ is highly **extensible** through [plug-ins](https://vpype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/vpype.html#module-vpype) that
can greatly extend its capabilities. For example, plug-ins already exists for plotting
[pixel art](https://github.com/abey79/vpype-pixelart), [half-toning with hatches](https://github.com/abey79/hatched),
[plotting text](https://github.com/abey79/vpype-text) with Hershey fonts,
applying [hidden line removal](https://github.com/LoicGoulefert/occult), and much more.  

_vpype_ is also a [well documented](https://vpype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/vpype.html#module-vpype) **Python library**
useful to create generative art and tools for plotters. For example, the plotter generative art environment
[vsketch](https://github.com/abey79/vsketch) is built upon _vpype_.

Check the [documentation](https://vpype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for a more thorough introduction to _vpype_.

## How does it work?

_vpype_ works by building so-called _pipelines_ of _commands_, where each command's output is fed to the next command's input.
Some commands load geometries into the pipeline (e.g. the [`read`](https://vpype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference.html#read)
command which loads geometries from a SVG file). Other commands modify these geometries, e.g. by cropping
them ([`crop`](https://vpype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference.html#crop)) or reordering them to minimize pen-up
travels ([`linesort`](https://vpype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference.html#linesort)). Finally, some other commands
just read the geometries in the pipeline for display purposes ([`show`](https://vpype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference.html#show))
or output to file ([`write`](https://vpype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference.html#write)).

Pipeline are defined using the _vpype_'s CLI (command-line interface) in a terminal by typing `vpype` followed by the
list of commands, each with their optional parameters and their arguments:

![command line](https://github.com/abey79/vpype/raw/master/docs/images/command_line.svg)

This pipeline uses five commands (in bold):
- [`read`](https://vpype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference.html#read) loads geometries from a SVG file.
- [`linemerge`](https://vpype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference.html#linemerge) merges paths whose extremities are close to each other (within the provided tolerance).
- [`linesort`](https://vpype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference.html#linesort) reorder paths such as to minimise the pen-up travel.
- [`crop`](https://vpype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference.html#crop), well, crops.
- [`write`](https://vpype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference.html#write) export the resulting geometries to a SVG file.

There are many more commands available in *vpype*, see the [overview](#feature-overview) below.

Some commands have arguments, which are always required (in italic). For example, a file path must be provided to the
[`read`](https://vpype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference.html#read) command and dimensions must be provided to the [`crop`](https://vpype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference.html#crop) commands. A command may also have options which are, well,
optional. In this example, `--page-size a4` means that the [`write`](https://vpype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference.html#write) command will generate a A4-sized SVG (otherwise it
would have the same size as _in.svg_). Likewise, because `--center` is used, the [`write`](https://vpype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference.html#write) command will center geometries
on the page before saving the SVG (otherwise the geometries would have been left at their original location).


## Examples

**Note**: although it is not required, commands are separated by multiple spaces for clarity in the following examples.

Load an SVG file, scale it to a specific size, and export it centered on an A4-sized, ready-to-plot SVG file:
```
vpype  read input.svg  scaleto 10cm 10cm  write --page-size a4 --center output.svg
```

Optimize paths to reduce plotting time (merge connected lines and sort them to minimize pen-up distance):
```
vpype  read input.svg  linemerge --tolerance 0.1mm  linesort  write output.svg
```

Visualize the path structure of large SVG files, showing whether lines are properly joined or not thanks to a colorful
display:
```
vpype  read input.svg  show --colorful
```

Load several SVG files and save them as a single, multi-layer SVG file (e.g. for multicolored drawings):
```
vpype  read -l 1 input1.svg  read -l 2 input2.svg  write output.svg
```

Create arbitrarily-sized, grid-like designs like this page's top banner:
```
vpype  begin  grid -o 1cm 1cm 10 13  script alien_letter.py  scaleto 0.5cm 0.5cm  end  show
```

Export to HPGL for vintage plotters:
```
vpype  read input.svg  write --device hp7475a --page-size a4 --landscape --center output.hpgl
```
  
## What _vpype_ isn't?

_vpype_ caters to plotter generative art and does not aim to be a general purpose (think
Illustrator/InkScape) vector graphic tools. One of the main reason for this is the fact _vpype_ converts everything 
curvy (circles, bezier curves, etc.) to lines made of small segments. _vpype_ also dismisses the stroke and fill
properties (color, line width, etc.) of the imported graphics. These design choices make possible _vpype_'s rich feature
set, but makes its use for, e.g., printed media limited. 
 
 
## Installation

Python 3.8 is recommended to use *vpype*, although it is also compatible with Python 3.6 and 3.7. Python 3.9 should be avoided for the time being due to the lack of binary distribution for several dependencies.

For Linux, install Python with your OS's default package manager. For macOS, Python is best installed from either
[MacPorts](https://www.macports.org) or [Homebrew](https://brew.sh). For Windows, use the
[official installer](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once Python is installed, *vpype* can be installed with the following command:

```bash
pip install vpype
```

Check [the documentation](https://vpype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) for more details, in particular on how to use a virtual environment (recommended).

## Documentation

The _vpype_ CLI includes its own, detailed documentation:

```bash
vpype --help          # general help and command list
vpype COMMAND --help  # help for a specific command
``` 

In addition, the [online documentation](https://vpype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) provides extensive background
information on the fundamentals behind _vpype_, a cookbook covering most common tasks, the _vpype_ API documentation,
and much more.
