## What _vpype_ is?

_vpype_ is the Swiss-Army-knife command-line tool for plotter vector graphics. Here is what it can do:
 - **layout** existing vector files with precise control on position, scale and page format;
 - **optimize** existing SVG files for faster and cleaner plots;
 - create **HPGL output** for vintage plotters;
 - create **generative artwork** from scratch through built-in commands or [plug-ins](#plug-ins);
 - create, modify and process **multi-layer vector files** for multi-colour plots;
 - and much more...
 
_vpype_ is highly **extensible** through plug-ins that can greatly extend its capabilities. For example, plug-ins
already exists for plotting [pixel art](https://github.com/abey79/vpype-pixelart),
[half-toning with hatches](https://github.com/abey79/hatched), and much more. See below for a
[list of existing plug-ins](#plug-ins).

_vpype_ is also a [well documented](https://vpype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html) **Python library**
useful to create generative art and tools for plotters. It includes data structures, utility and I/O functions, as well as
a hardware-accelerated flexible viewer for vector graphics. For example, the plotter generative art environment
[vsketch](https://github.com/abey79/vsketch) is built upon _vpype_.

Check the [documentation](https://vpype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for a more thorough introduction to _vpype_.

## How does it work?

_vpype_ works by building so-called _pipelines_ of _commands_, where each command's output is fed to the next command's input.
Some commands load geometries into the pipeline (e.g. the [`read`](https://vpype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference.html#read)
command which loads geometries from a SVG file). Other commands modify these geometries, e.g. by cropping
them ([`crop`](https://vpype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference.html#crop)) or reordering them to minimize pen-up
travels ([`linesort`](https://vpype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference.html#linesort)). Finally, some other commands
just read the geometries in the pipeline for display purposes ([`show`](https://vpype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference.html#show))
or output to file ([`write`](https://vpype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference.html#write)).

Pipeline are defined using the _vpype_'s CLI (command-line interface) in a terminal by typing `vpype` followed by the
list of commands, each with their optional parameters and their arguments:

![command line](https://github.com/abey79/vpype/raw/master/docs/images/command_line.svg)

This pipeline uses five commands (in bold):
- [`read`](https://vpype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference.html#read) loads geometries from a SVG file.
- [`linemerge`](https://vpype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference.html#linemerge) merges paths whose extremities are close to each other (within the provided tolerance).
- [`linesort`](https://vpype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference.html#linesort) reorder paths such as to minimise the pen-up travel.
- [`crop`](https://vpype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference.html#crop), well, crops.
- [`write`](https://vpype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference.html#write) export the resulting geometries to a SVG file.

There are many more commands available in *vpype*, see the [overview](#feature-overview) below.

Some commands have arguments, which are always required (in italic). For example, a file path must be provided to the
[`read`](https://vpype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference.html#read) command and dimensions must be provided to the [`crop`](https://vpype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference.html#crop) commands. A command may also have options which are, well,
optional. In this example, `--page-size a4` means that the [`write`](https://vpype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference.html#write) command will generate a A4-sized SVG (otherwise it
would have the same size as _in.svg_). Likewise, because `--center` is used, the [`write`](https://vpype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference.html#write) command will center geometries
on the page before saving the SVG (otherwise the geometries would have been left at their original location).


## Examples

**Note**: The following examples are laid out over multiple lines using end-of-line escaping (`\`). This is done to highlight the various commands of which the pipeline is made and would typically not be done in real-world use. 

Load an SVG file, scale it to a specific size, and export it centered on an A4-sized, ready-to-plot SVG file:
```bash
$ vpype \
  read input.svg \
  layout --fit-to-margins 2cm a4 \
  write output.svg
```

Optimize paths to reduce plotting time (merge connected lines, sort them to minimize pen-up distance, randomize closed paths' seam, and reduce the number of nodes):
```bash
$ vpype \
  read input.svg \
  linemerge --tolerance 0.1mm \
  linesort \
  reloop \
  linesimplify \
  write output.svg
```

Load a SVG and display it in *vpype*'s viewer, which enable close inspection of the layer and path structure):
```bash
$ vpype \
  read input.svg \
  show
```

Load several SVG files and save them as a single, multi-layer SVG file (e.g. for multicolored drawings):
```bash
$ vpype \
  forfile "*.svg" \
    read --layer %_i% %_path% \
  end \
  write output.svg
```

Export a SVG to HPGL for vintage plotters:
```bash
$ vpype \
  read input.svg \
  layout --fit-to-margins 2cm --landscape a4 \
  write --device hp7475a output.hpgl
```

Draw the layer name on a SVG (this example uses [property substitution](https://vpype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fundamentals.html#property-substitution)):
```bash
$ vpype \
    read input.svg \
    text --layer 1 "{vp_name}" \
    write output.svg
```

Merge multiple SVG files in a grid layout (this example uses [expression substitution](https://vpype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fundamentals.html#expression-substitution)):
```bash
$ vpype \
    eval "files=glob('*.svg')" \
    eval "cols=3; rows=ceil(len(files)/cols)" \
    grid -o 10cm 10cm "%cols%" "%rows%" \
        read --no-fail "%files[_i] if _i < len(files) else ''%" \
        layout -m 0.5cm 10x10cm \
    end \
    write combined_on_a_grid.svg
```

An interactive version of the previous example is available in `examples/grid.vpy`. It makes use of `input()` expressions to ask parameters from the user:
```bash
$ vpype -I examples/grid.vpy
Files [*.svg]?
Number of columns [3]? 4
Column width [10cm]?
Row height [10cm]? 15cm
Margin [0.5cm]?
Output path [output.svg]?
```

Split a SVG into one file per layer:
```bash
$ vpype \
    read input.svg \
    forlayer \
      write "output_%_name or _lid%.svg" \
    end
```

More examples and recipes are available in the [cookbook](https://vpype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cookbook.html). 
  
## What _vpype_ isn't?

_vpype_ caters to plotter generative art and does not aim to be a general purpose (think
Illustrator/InkScape) vector graphic tools. One of the main reason for this is the fact _vpype_ converts everything 
curvy (circles, bezier curves, etc.) to lines made of small segments. _vpype_ does import metadata such stroke and fill color, stroke width, etc., it only makes partial use of them and does not aim to maintain a full consistency with the SVG specification. These design choices make _vpype_'s rich feature set possible, but limits its use for, e.g., printed media. 
 
 
## Installation

Detailed installation instructions are available in the [latest documentation](https://vpype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).

TL;DR:
- Python 3.10 is recommended, but *vpype* is also compatible with Python 3.8 and 3.9. 
- *vpype* is published on the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org) and can be installed using [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/):
  ```bash
  pipx install "vpype[all]"
  ```
- Installing on M1 Mac requires special care â€” check the [installation instruction](https://vpype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#installing-using-pipx-apple-silicon-m1).
- A Windows installer is available [here](https://github.com/abey79/vpype/releases) (plug-ins cannot be installed
when using this installation method).
- A CLI-only version of *vpype* can be installed using the following command:
  ```bash
  pipx install vpype
  ```
  This version does not include the [`show`](https://vpype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference.html#show) command but does not require some of the dependencies which are more difficult or impossible to install on some platforms (such as matplotlib, PySide2, and ModernGL).


## Documentation

The _vpype_ CLI includes its own, detailed documentation:

```bash
vpype --help          # general help and command list
vpype COMMAND --help  # help for a specific command
``` 

In addition, the [online documentation](https://vpype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) provides extensive background
information on the fundamentals behind _vpype_, a cookbook covering most common tasks, the _vpype_ API documentation,
and much more.
