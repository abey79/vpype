# _vpype_ ![Test](https://github.com/abey79/vpype/workflows/Test/badge.svg?branch=master) [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/vpype/badge/?version=latest)](https://vpype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)


> **Note**: a proper documentation is [under construction](https://vpype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

_vpype_ aims to be the one-stop-shop, Swiss Army knife<sup>1</sup> for producing plotter-ready vector graphics. Here
are, for illustration, a few examples of what it can do:
 
- Load a SVG, scale it to a specific size, and export it centered on a A4, ready-to-plot SVG.
    ```bash
    $ vpype read input.svg scale --to 10cm 10cm write --page-format a4 --center output.svg
    ```
- Visualize the path structure of large SVG file, checking thanks to a colorful display if lines are properly joined or
    not.
    ```bash
    $ vpype read input.svg show --colorful
    ```
- Optimize paths to reduce plotting time (merge connected lines and sort them to minimize pen-up distance):
    ```bash
    $ vpype read input.svg linemerge --tolerance 0.1mm linesort write output.svg
    ``` 
- Load several SVGs and save them into a single, multi-layer SVG for polychromic drawings.
    ```bash
    $ vpype read -l 1 input1.svg read -l 2 input2.svg write output.svg
    ```
- Create arbitrarily-sized, grid-like designs like this page's top banner.
    ```bash
    $ vpype begin grid -o 1cm 1cm 10 13 script alien_letter.py scaleto 0.5cm 0.5cm end show
    ```
- Export to HPGL for vintage plotters.
    ```bash
    $ vpype read input.svg write --device hp7475a --page-format a4 --landscape --center output.hpgl
    ```

At its core, _vpype_ allows the user to build pipelines of _commands_, each of which receives a
collection of vector graphics (basically, lines), modifies them and/or produce new ones, and pass them to the next
command. _vpype_'s simple CLI user interface makes it a breeze to create these pipelines, which can be expended thanks
to a [plug-in](PLUGINS.md) architecture.

Let's have a close look at an example:

```bash
$ vpype random --count 100 --area 10cm 10cm rotate 45 write --page-format a4 --center output.svg
```

This pipelines uses 3 commands (`random`, `rotate` and `write`) to generates 100 random lines in a 10x10cm square,
rotate them by 45 degrees, and saves them in the middle of an A4 SVG file. This is how the output would look like in
InkScape:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/d9fSrRh.png" alt="100 random lines in a 10x10cm box rotated by 45 degrees" width=300>

As _vpype_ focuses only on vector graphics used as input for plotters, its data model is very simple and only includes
paths, at the exclusion of formatting (line color, width, etc.), filled shapes, bitmaps, etc. This is the core of what
makes _vpype_ both simple and powerful at what it does.

## Getting Started

### Installation

See [installation instructions](INSTALL.md).


### Running examples

A few examples are available in the `examples` sub-directory, in the form of bash scripts. The script used to create
the top banner is included:

```bash
$ cd examples
$ ./alien.sh
```


### Documentation

The CLI user interface documentation is available through the `--help` option. Use `vpype --help` to see a list of
all available commands:

```text
$ vpype --help
Usage: vpype [OPTIONS] COMMAND1 [ARGS]... [COMMAND2 [ARGS]...]...

Options:
  -v, --verbose
  -I, --include PATH  Load commands from a command file.
  --help              Show this message and exit.

Commands:

  [...]

  Input:
    read       Extract geometries from a SVG file.
    script     Call an external python script to generate geometries.

  Transforms:
    rotate     Rotate the geometries.
    scale      Scale the geometries.
    skew       Skew the geometries.
    translate  Translate the geometries.

  [...]
```

Use `vpype COMMAND --help` for information on a specific command, for example:

```text
$ vpype scale --help
Usage: vpype scale [OPTIONS] SCALE...

  Scale the geometries by a factor.

  The origin used is the bounding box center, unless the `--origin` option
  is used.

  By default, act on all layers. If one or more layer IDs are provided with
  the `--layer` option, only these layers will be affected. In this case,
  the bounding box is that of the listed layers.

  Example:

      Double the size of the geometries in layer 1, using (0, 0) as origin:

          vpype [...] scale -l 1 -o 0 0 2 2 [...]

Options:
  -l, --layer LAYERS      Target layer(s).
  -o, --origin LENGTH...  Use a specific origin.
  --help                  Show this message and exit.
```


### Generators, filters and sinks

It is useful to consider that, at first sight, commands can be classified in three broad categories based on what they
do:

- _Generators_ create new geometries (e.g. read from a SVG, generate random lines, etc.).
- _Filters_ alter the existing geometries (e.g. translate, rotate, etc.).
- _Sinks_ use the existing geometries for display or export without modifying them.
 
Generators are typically at the beginning of the pipelines while the sinks are most commonly found at the end. This
classification is not strict though, nor it is important internally. A command could both modify existing geometries and
add new ones, and sinks don't actual "eat" geometries as the definition implies. Geometries are instead passed on, which
enables multiple sinks to be chained (e.g. first display the result, then save it to SVG).

Here is a non-exhaustive list of important commands:

- `read`: import geometries from a SVG file
- `line`, `rect`, `arc`, `circle`: create the corresponding primitives 
- `script`: execute a Python script to generate geometries (see [External scripts](#external-scripts))
- `translate`, `rotate`, `scale`, `skew`: basic transformation commands which do exactly what you think they do
- `crop`: crop the geometries, removing everything outside of a rectangular area
- `linemerge`: merge lines whose endings overlap or are very close
- `linesort`: sort lines to minimize the total distance between the end of a path to the start of the next one
- `multipass`: prepare twp-pass (or more) files for when a single stroke isn't sufficient for a good render 
- `frame`: add a simple frame around the geometries
- `lmove`, `lcopy`, `ldelete`: various layer manipulation commands 
- `show`: display the geometries in a `matplotlib` window
- `write`: save the geometries as a SVG or HPGL file


### Data model and units

Being designed for plotter data, all _vpype_ understands is lines. Specifically, straight lines. This makes _vpype_ a
very poor general purpose vector graphics tool, but hopefully a good one when dealing with graphics files sent to
plotters. When loading geometries from existing SVG file (using the `read` command), curved paths such as Bezier
curves or ellipses are converted into multiple, typically small segments. The quantization interval is 1mm by default,
but can be changed with the `--quantization` option of the `read` command.

Internally, _vpype_ use the CSS pixel as unit, which is defined as 1/96th of an inch, which happens to be the default
unit used by the SVG format. Most commands understand other standard units thought, including `in`, `cm`, `mm`, `pt` and
`pc`. These two commands thus generate the same output (100 random lines in a 1x1in square in the middle of an A4 page):

```bash
$ vpype random --count 100 --area 96 96 write --page-format a4 --center output.svg
$ vpype random --count 100 --area 1in 1in write --page-format a4 --center output.svg
```


### Layers

_vpype_ supports multiple layers and can produce multi-layer SVGs, which can be useful for polychromic drawings.
Most commands have a `-l, --layer` option which affects how layers are created and/or modified.
Layers are always referred to by a non-zero, positive integer (which ties nicely with how official
[AxiDraw](https://axidraw.com) tools deal with layers). 

Generators such as `line`, `script`, etc. create new geometries. The `--layer` option controls which layer receives
these new geometries. By default, the last target layer is used:
```
$ vpype line --layer 3 0 0 1cm 1cm circle 0.5cm 0.5cm 0.5cm show
``` 
Here both the line and the circle will be in layer 3. If no generator specifies a target layer, then layer 1 is assumed
by default.

The `read` honors the input SVG layer structure and will create layers for each top-level SVG groups (see the CLI help
for details). Alternatively, it can run in single-layer mode with `--single-layer`. In this case, all geometries are
loaded in one layer, regardless of the SVG's structure.

Filters such as `translate`, `rotate`, `crop`, `linemerge`,  etc. modify existing geometries. The `--layer` option
controls if one, several or all layers will be affected:
```
$ vpype [...] rotate --layer 1 [...]
$ vpype [...] rotate --layer 1,2,4 [...]
$ vpype [...] rotate --layer all [...]
```
All these commands do exactly what you think they should do. If the `--layer` option is omitted, then `all` is assumed.
Note that if you provide a list of layers, they must be comma separated and without any whitespace, as the list must be
a single CLI argument.

Some commands do not have a `--layer` option, but understand them. For example, `show` will display each layer
in a different color by default. Last but not least, `write` will generate multi-layer SVGs which will work 
out-of-the-box with InkScape.

Finally, layers' content can be moved or copied to other layers with the `lmove` and `lcopy` commands, and outright
deleted with the `ldelete` command. See these commands' help for details.


### External scripts

The `script` command is a very useful generator that relies on an external Python script to produce geometries. Its
use is demonstrated by the `alien.sh` and `alien2.sh` examples. A path to a Python file must be passed as argument.
The file must implement a `generate()` function which returns a Shapely `MultiLineString` object. This is very easy
and explained in the [Shapely documentation](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual.html#collections-of-lines).


### Blocks

Blocks refer to a portion of the pipeline marked by the `begin` and `end` special commands.
The command immediately following `begin` is called the _block processor_ and defines how many times this portion of
the pipeline will be used. For example, the `grid` block layer_processor repeatedly execute the block and arranges the
resulting geometries on a regular NxM grid. This is how the top banner has been generated:

```bash
vpype begin \
  grid --offset 1.5cm 1.5cm 13 20 \
  script alien_letter.py \
  scale --to 0.8cm 0.8cm \
end \
write --page-format a3 --center alien.svg
```

The pipelines above mainly consist of a block with the `grid` block layer_processor. It is repeated on the 13 by 20 grid, with
a spacing of 1.5cm in both direction. On each of these location, the script `alien_letter.py` is executed to generate
some geometries, which are then scaled to a 0.8x0.8cm size. After the block, we `write` the result to a SVG.

Notice how, with added newlines and proper indenting, the sequence of commands emerges as a kind of mini-language. You
guessed it, blocks can be nested to achieve more complex compositions. Here is an example:

```bash
vpype begin \
  grid --offset 8cm 8cm 2 3 \
    begin \
      grid --offset 2cm 2cm 3 3 \
      random --count 20 --area 1cm 1cm \
      frame \
    end \
  frame --offset 0.3cm \
end \
show
```

This pipeline should display the following:

### Command file

When pipelines become complex, the number of command-line arguments can become too large to be convenient. To address
this, `vpype` support the inclusion of command files in the pipeline. A command file is a text file whose content is
interpreted as if it was command-line arguments.

The previous example can be converted to a command file with the following content:
```bash
# this is an example command file 
begin
  grid --offset 8cm 8cm 2 3
    begin
      grid --offset 2cm 2cm 3 3
      random --count 20 --area 1cm 1cm
      frame
    end
  frame --offset 0.3cm
end
show
```

The command file can then be loaded as argument using the `-I` or `--include` option:

```bash
$ vpype -I command_file.vpy
``` 

Newlines and indentation are ignored and useful only for readability. Everything right of a `#` character is considered
a comment and thus ignored. Command files can be mixed with regular arguments too:

```text
$ vpype -I generate_lines.vpy write -p a4 -c output.svg
```

Finally, command files can also include other command files:

```text
# Example command file
begin
  grid --offset 1cm 1cm 2 2
  -I sub_command.vpy
end
show
```


### Plug-ins
