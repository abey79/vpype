#### 1.3 (2021-01-27)

New features and improvements:
* Added new `layout` command (#168)
  
  This command automates the page layout process on a specified the page size by centering the geometries (with
  customizable horizontal and vertical alignment) and optionally fitting to specified margins. It intends to supersede
  `write`'s layout options (i.e. `--page-size` and `--center`) in more intuitive way. In particular this command
  acts on the pipeline rather than on the output file so its effect can be previewed with the `show` command.

* (Beta) Complete rewrite of the viewer underlying the `show` command (#163)
  * fully hardware-accelerated rendering engine
  * smooth zooming and panning, with touchpad and mouse support
  * preview mode with adjustable pen width and opacity
  * outline mode with optional colorful and point display
  * optional pen-up trajectories display
  * per-layer visibility control
  * interactively adjustable display settings
    
  **Note**: This new viewer is a beta feature and will evolve in future versions. Your feedback is welcome. The current, matplotlib-based viewer is still available using `show --classic`.

* Added support for arbitrary paper size to `write`'s HPGL output (configuration for the Calcomp Designmate included, check the documentation for details) (#178)
* Added large format paper sizes (A2, A1, A0) (#144)
* The `splitall` command will now filter out segments with identical end-points (#146)
* Minor loading time improvement (#133)
