Why?

Thanks to the CLI library which underlies *vpype* (`Click <https://click.palletsprojects.com>`_), writing plug-ins is easy and makes it a compelling option for your next plotter project. Plug-ins directly benefit from *vpype*'s facilities, such as SVG export, line optimization and sorting, scaling and pagination, etc. Plug-ins also benefit from the Click-inherited facilities to easily create compelling CLI interfaces to parametrize your plug-in.

Here are a few existing plug-ins to illustrate the possibilities:

* `vpype-text <https://github.com/abey79/vpype-text>`_: generate plottable text with Hershey fonts (based on `axi <https://github.com/fogleman/axi>`_)

* `vpype-pixelart <https://github.com/abey79/vpype-pixelart>`_: easy pixel art plotting

- `hatched <https://github.com/abey79/hatched>`_: convert images to hatched patterns

How?
====

.. highlight:: bash

The easiest way to start a plug-in project is to use the `Cookiecutter <https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io>`_ template for *vpype* plug-ins. You will first need to install ``cookiecutter`` command (see the website for more info). Then, run the following command::

  $ cookiecutter gh:abey79/cookiecutter-vpype-plugin

Cookiecutter will ask you a few questions and create a project structure automatically. To make it operational, the plug-in and its dependencies (including *vpype* itself) must be installed in a local virtual environment::

  $ cd my-vpype-plugin/
  $ python3 -m venv venv
  $ source venv/bin/activate
  $ pip install --upgrade pip
  $ pip install --editable .

Note the use of the ``--editable`` flag when installing the plug-in. With this flag, the actual code in the plug-in project is used for the plug-in, which means you can freely edit the source of the plug-in and it is automatically used the next time *vpype* is run.

Let's check that that everything works as expected::

  $ vpype --help
  Usage: vpype [OPTIONS] COMMAND1 [ARGS]... [COMMAND2 [ARGS]...]...

  Options:
    -v, --verbose
    -I, --include PATH  Load commands from a command file.
    --help              Show this message and exit.

  Commands:

    ...

    Plugins:
      my-vpype-plugin  Insert documentation here.

    ...

The cookiecutter project includes a single :ref:`generator <fundamentals_generators>` command with the :py:func:`generator` decorator:

.. code-block:: python

  import click
  from vpype import LineCollection, generator

  @click.command()
  @generator
  def my_vpype_plugin():
      """Insert documentation here.
      """
      lc = LineCollection()
      return lc

  my_vpype_plugin.help_group = "Plugins"

Generator commands must return a :py:class:`LineCollection` instance. Plug-in can also contain :ref:`layer processor <fundamentals_layer_processors>` or :ref:`global processor <fundamentals_global_processors>` command, respectively using the :py:func:`layer_processor` and :py:func:`global_processor` decorators. Check the API reference for more information.
