  External scripts
  ================

  The `script` command is a very useful generator that relies on an external Python script to produce geometries. Its
  use is demonstrated by the `alien.sh` and `alien2.sh` examples. A path to a Python file must be passed as argument.
  The file must implement a `generate()` function which returns a Shapely `MultiLineString` object. This is very easy
  and explained in the [Shapely documentation](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual.html#collections-of-lines).
